Revision history for Perl extension Text::Fracture.

1.02  Thu Jun 26 01:39:38 CEST 2008
	- new wheighting code, new mountaineering algorithm.
	- fract is no longer fragile.
	- studied rolling hash in rsync and spamsum.
	- decided to keep the mountaineering algorithm
	  and improved it further to behave in pathological cases.
	- Done excessive testing. Really nice now.

	- made cooked() aware of \v and \f.
	- found that the fract-algorithm is fragile.
	  a local text change can have global effects.
	  -> re-designing...
	- do_fract() is now a shell for a new upcoming 
	  algorithm, it only takes care of offset calculation.
	  And it does it right for the first time.
	- char_stat() implemented, tested good.
	- weight_line() started, unfinished.

0.08  Thu Sep 13 01:52:12 CEST 2007
	- added draft of cooked() code.

0.07  Thu Sep  6 23:43:30 CEST 2007
	- fixed the final off by one error. :-)

0.06  Wed Aug 29 23:57:22 CEST 2007
	- char_input_fetch() no longer returns offsets > text_len
	  when faking a terminal newline.
	  Off by one in line counting fixed.

0.05  Thu Aug 23 22:20:49 CEST 2007
	- in_ra_buf() update never happened due to inverted logic.
	  line weights look good now.

0.04  Thu Aug 23 01:16:25 CEST 2007
	- frac() code implementation completed. untested.

0.03  Tue Aug 21 21:25:13 CEST 2007
	- frac() loop implementation half done.

0.02  Sun Aug 19 11:00:25 CEST 2007
	- expanded ruleset definition in perldoc Fracture.pm
	- introduced struct line [], instead of llen[].
	- odd: Config_heavy.pl brings in compiler command line parameters,
	  but does not check which compiler we use.
	  gcc-4.0.2 does not understand -fstack-protector.

0.01  Fri Aug 17 21:26:35 CEST 2007
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-A -n Text-Fracture
	- Changed XSLoader::load('Text-Fracture', ...) into
	          XSLoader::load('Text::Fracture', ...);
	  to make it find it .so module. h2xs bug. grrr.
	- test.pl runs, but only dummy code in fract().
